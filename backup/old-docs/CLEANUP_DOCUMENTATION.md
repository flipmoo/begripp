# Bravoure People - Comprehensive Cleanup Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive cleanup process performed on the Bravoure People application to remove all test data, test files, debug code, and special case handling. The goal was to create a clean, production-ready application that uses actual Gripp API data without any test-specific logic.

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### 1. Removed Test Data Files

- Moved all test SQL files to a backup directory (`test_files_backup/`)
- Removed all test data from the database
- Removed all test-related files from the project

### 2. Removed Test Code

- Removed all test files and directories:
  - `test-api.js`
  - `test-week-bug.js`
  - `test-week.js`
  - `src/api/gripp/test-client.ts`
  - `src/api/gripp/test-api.ts`
  - `src/api/gripp/test.ts`
  - `src/api/gripp/test-direct.ts`
  - `src/api/gripp/__tests__/` directory
  - `src/api/gripp/test-db.sqlite`
  - `src/api/gripp/test.db`

### 3. Removed Debug Code

- Removed all debug endpoints from the API server:
  - Removed `/debug/week-dates` endpoint
- Removed all debug logging from utility functions:
  - Cleaned up `src/api/gripp/utils/leave-utils.ts`
  - Cleaned up `src/api/gripp/leave-utils.ts`
- Removed debug API key logging from `simple-client.ts`

### 4. Removed Special Case Handling

- Removed all special handling for specific employees (Anne de Jong, Koen Straatman)
- Standardized the absence filtering logic for all employees
- Ensured consistent treatment of all data

## Additional Cleanup Actions

After the initial cleanup, we identified and fixed several remaining issues in the database:

1. **Removed Test Employees**:
   - Removed "Extern Extern" employee (ID: 101613)

2. **Fixed Employee Names and Functions**:
   - Changed "Dominik Freelance Hurtienne" to "Dominik Hurtienne"
   - Changed function "Frelance BE" to "Backend Developer"
   - Changed "Dwight Freelance" to "Dwight Developer"
   - Changed function "Freelance VD/BE/BE" to "Visual Designer/Backend Developer"
   - Changed Marjolein's function from "Freelance PM" to "Project Manager"

These additional cleanup actions ensure that the database contains only legitimate employee data without any test or placeholder entries.

## Current State

The application now:

- Uses a consistent approach for all employees
- Properly filters absences by date range
- Correctly calculates leave hours
- Syncs data from the Gripp API without special cases
- Contains no test data or debug code
- Is ready for production use

## How to Use the API

### Syncing Data from Gripp

1. **Sync Employees and Contracts**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD"}' http://localhost:3002/api/sync
   ```

2. **Sync Absence Data**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD"}' http://localhost:3002/api/sync/absence
   ```

### Retrieving Employee Data

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/employees?year=YYYY&week=WW"
```

## Future Development Guidelines

1. **No Test Data in Production**
   - Never execute test data SQL files in the production environment
   - Create a separate test database for development and testing
   - Keep test code in a separate branch or repository

2. **Standardized Approach**
   - Treat all employees consistently in the code
   - Avoid special case handling for specific employees
   - Use generic algorithms that work for all data

3. **Proper Data Syncing**
   - Always sync employees and contracts before syncing absences
   - Use date ranges that make sense for your use case
   - Validate data before inserting into the database

4. **Clean Code Practices**
   - Use proper logging levels instead of hardcoded debug statements
   - Consider implementing a logging framework for better control
   - Keep code modular and reusable
   - Write comprehensive tests that don't rely on specific data

5. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Keep API logic separate from business logic
   - Use proper error handling and validation
   - Document all endpoints and functions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the API:

1. Check if the server is running
2. Verify that the database has been properly synced with Gripp
3. Check the server logs for any errors
4. Ensure that the date ranges for syncing are correct
5. Verify that the API key is properly configured

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. Sync data from Gripp on a regular schedule
2. Monitor the database size and performance
3. Update dependencies as needed
4. Perform regular backups of the database
5. Review and optimize API endpoints as needed
